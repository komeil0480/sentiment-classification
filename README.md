In this project, we undertake a comparative exploration of two powerful deep learning paradigms: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. The primary focus is sentiment classification, but with distinct approaches and datasets.

RNN Sentiment Analysis:
In the RNN segment, we dive deep into the world of sentiment analysis. Our goal is to train an RNN-based model for binary sentiment classification using a carefully curated dataset. Extensive data preprocessing ensures the model's efficiency, and text samples are filtered to contain fewer than 70 tokens, minimizing the need for excessive padding. Key project highlights include:

Thorough Data Preprocessing
Tokenization and Padding
RNN Model Architecture
Training and Evaluation
Transformer Emotion Classification:
In the transformer segment, we shift our focus to multiclass emotion classification using the Twitter Emotion dataset. Here, we harness the Hugging Face Transformers library to construct and fine-tune transformer-based models. The dataset showcases diverse emotional labels, necessitating advanced techniques for classification. The project encompasses:

Transformer-Based Approach
Data Analysis and Encoding
Model Training
Evaluation and Visualization
